# Projects and Apps overview

### Understanding Web Development and Django Framework

When learning web development, it's important to understand what is required to build a website. Here’s a detailed and structured summary of key concepts, focusing on the **Django framework** and its **projects and apps** structure.

#### Basic Website Structure
A typical website includes:
- **HTML** for the page structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for client-side interactions

For a simple static website, you only need some **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **image folders**. This structure makes files easy to update.

#### Complex Web Applications
For web applications that need to **hold state or access and store data**, a more complex setup is necessary. **Using a framework** like Django helps developers focus on creating unique functionality instead of repetitive tasks.

#### The Role of Django
**Django** was created by developers who follow best practices. It allows you to set up your web application in a **structured way for easier development**. Django provides a set of commands to auto-generate a project structure containing the configuration and settings related to the entire web application.

#### Core Concepts of Projects and Apps in Django
**Projects and Apps** are the core concepts in Django that provide structure for development.

**Projects**:
- **Represent the entire web application**
- Auto-generated by Django to organize **Python files and folders**
- Allow developers to focus on coding rather than configuration

**Apps**:
- **Sub-modules of a project** that implement specific functionalities
- **Self-contained**, meaning they don’t rely on other apps to function
- Can be **used or reused** in many different projects

#### Internet Protocols and Server Configuration
To create a dynamic web application, you need to understand:
- **Internet Protocols**: HTTP is used to get, send, and render web content.
- **Web Server Configuration**: A web server gets the page users want and returns it via HTTP.
- **Data Retrieval and Storage**: The web is stateless, so a database is required to store and retrieve data.

Django comes with its own **development server written in Python**, saving time and avoiding messy configurations.

#### Understanding HTTP and Databases
- **HTTP**: Essential for web development as every action ties into an HTTP request pointing to some URL.
- **Databases**: Necessary for storing data that can be retrieved and rendered later, such as form submissions.

#### Setting Up a Django Project
A Django project:
- **Organizes code** and provides a structured way to develop
- Contains many **apps**, each for a specific feature
- For example, a social media application project could have separate apps for the news feed, comments, friends list, and user page.

#### Working with Apps in Django
- **Adding Apps**: Use the `startapp` command.
- **Recognizing Apps**: Add to the `installed apps` setting in Django.
- **App Structure**: Includes models, views, templates, template tags, static files, URLs, and middleware.

#### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle
- **Write once but use many times**: Apps should be feature-targeted, focusing on one thing only.
- Throughout this course, you will work with a project containing only one app.

#### Conclusion
In this course, you learned about the **core concepts of projects and apps in Django** and how they provide a structure for a developer to work from. By understanding these foundational elements, you can efficiently build and manage complex web applications using Django.

# Project Structure

### Project Structure in Django

When installing Django globally or in a virtual environment, it's recommended to use isolated environments for libraries and other dependencies required for a particular application. Python's standard library contains the **venv module**, which helps create these isolated environments. This module installs a command-line utility called **Django-admin** in the system path, located in the scripts folder of your current Python environment.

**Django-admin** is used to perform various administrative tasks such as creating projects and apps, performing migrations, and running a development server.

#### What is a Django Project?

A **Django project** is a Python package that includes database configurations and other Django-specific settings. It controls the standard features of various sub-modules (called **apps** in Django). To create a project, use the `startproject` command:

```shell
django-admin startproject demoproject
```

This command creates the following file structure:

```
demoproject/
│   manage.py
│
└───demoproject/
        asgi.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        __init__.py
```

**manage.py**: A script that performs administrative tasks, similar to **django-admin**.

**demoproject** folder: Contains Django-specific settings and configurations.

#### Detailed Summary

**Project Structure**:
- **manage.py**: A local copy of the django-admin utility. Used to perform administrative tasks.
- **demoproject** folder:
  - **asgi.py**: Used by ASGI servers for serving asynchronous web applications.
  - **settings.py**: Contains configurations and settings for the Django project.
  - **urls.py**: Maps URLs to views.
  - **wsgi.py**: Entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers.
  - **__init__.py**: Indicates that the folder is a Python package.

**Using manage.py**:
- **General Usage**: `python manage.py <command>`
- **Common Commands**:
  - **startapp**: `python manage.py startapp <name_of_app>`
  - **makemigrations**: `python manage.py makemigrations`
  - **migrate**: `python manage.py migrate`
  - **runserver**: `python manage.py runserver`
  - **shell**: `python manage.py shell`

**Project Package**:
- **startproject command** creates a project folder with another folder of the same name inside it, forming a Python package.
- **__init__.py**: Marks the folder as a Python package.

**Critical Settings in settings.py**:
- **INSTALLED_APPS**: List of installed apps in the project.
- **DATABASES**: Configuration for the databases used by the project.
- **DEBUG**: Enables/disables debug mode.
- **ALLOWED_HOSTS**: List of hosts/domains allowed to serve the Django site.
- **ROOT_URLCONF**: Points to the module containing the project's URL patterns.
- **STATIC_URL**: Points to the folder containing static files like JavaScript, CSS, and images.

**Testing the Installation**:
- To verify the project is built correctly, start the development server:
  ```shell
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
- Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the Django welcome page, confirming the successful creation of the project.

#### Conclusion

In this reading, you learned how to create a Django project and understand its file structure. The **django-admin** utility and **manage.py** script are crucial for managing and maintaining a Django project. The detailed explanation of settings and commands will help you efficiently manage your Django applications.

# Creating your first project

### Creating Your First Django Project with VS Code and the Terminal

When learning web development with Django, it's crucial to understand the process of setting up your development environment, creating a project, and running a development server. Below, you'll find a step-by-step guide to creating your first Django project using the terminal and the VS Code editor.

#### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Create a Project Directory**:
   - Open a new terminal by choosing *Terminal* > *New Terminal* from the top menu.
   - Create a new directory using the `mkdir` (make directory) command:
     ```shell
     mkdir build_django
     ```
   - Change into this directory using the `cd` (change directory) command:
     ```shell
     cd build_django
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Set up a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated:
     ```shell
     python3 -m venv tutorial-env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On **Windows**:
       ```shell
       tutorial-env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **macOS/Linux**:
       ```shell
       source tutorial-env/bin/activate
       ```
   - Notice that the virtual environment is activated by the round brackets suffix in the terminal.

3. **Install Django**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, install Django:
     ```shell
     pip install django
     ```
   - Verify the installation by checking the Django version:
     ```shell
     python3 -m django --version
     ```
   - The command should return the current Django version, e.g., 4.1.

#### Creating a Django Project

1. **Create a New Django Project**:
   - Use Django's built-in command line tools to create a project:
     ```shell
     django-admin startproject shifts_table
     ```
   - This command creates a new directory named `shifts_table` with the necessary Django files.
