# SQL Arithmetic Operators

Sure! Here's a more structured and engaging summary of the topic, broken down into key parts:

### Introduction to SQL Arithmetic Operators
Imagine you manage a **corporate database** with **information about hundreds of employees**. How can you efficiently and accurately calculate **salary increases** or adjust **allowances** for all employees? The answer lies in using **SQL arithmetic operators**.

### What Are Operators in SQL?
**Operators** in SQL are like **tools** that help you perform various tasks within a database. Think of them as the **conjunctions** in a sentence or the **operation keys** on a calculator. They enable you to **query and manipulate data** for different purposes.

### Importance of SQL Operators
Why should you care about these operators? When handling data, you'll need to **manipulate and query it**. **SQL operators** are essential for these tasks, allowing you to perform calculations and comparisons. For instance, you can determine how many **leave days** an employee has left or if they are meeting company targets.

### Types of Arithmetic Operators
Let's dive into some common **arithmetic operators** in SQL:

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two values.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one value from another.
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two values.
- **Division (/)**: Divides one value by another.
- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division.

### How Do SQL Arithmetic Operations Work?
When you perform a calculation, an operator takes two **operands** and returns a **result**. For example, the **addition operator** can take the numbers 5 and 5, and return 10. In SQL, you use the **SELECT command** to perform these operations.

### Example Calculations in SQL
Let's illustrate these concepts with some examples:

1. **Addition**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 10 + 15;
   ```
   This returns **25**.

2. **Subtraction**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 15 - 15;
   ```
   This returns **0**.

3. **Multiplication**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 5 * 5;
   ```
   This returns **25**.

4. **Division**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 5 / 5;
   ```
   This returns **1**.

5. **Modulus**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 100 % 10;
   ```
   This returns **0** (since 100 divided by 10 leaves no remainder).

### Performing Basic Operations
To use these operators in SQL, simply combine them with the **SELECT command**:
```sql
SELECT 10 + 15;   -- Addition
SELECT 20 - 5;    -- Subtraction
SELECT 4 * 5;     -- Multiplication
SELECT 20 / 4;    -- Division
SELECT 20 % 3;    -- Modulus
```

### Conclusion
You've now learned about **SQL arithmetic operators** and how to use them to perform basic mathematical operations. With this knowledge, you're ready to apply these operators in more practical and complex ways to manage your corporate database efficiently. Awesome work!

# SQL Arithmetic Operator Examples

In this reading, you'll explore more about the **arithmetic operators** that can be used with **SQL**. You've already learned about the basic arithmetic operators in SQL, such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**, and the **modulus operator**, which gives the remainder of a mathematical division. The main objective here is to present more examples and include some **advanced scenarios**.

#### Arithmetic Operators
**Arithmetic operators** are useful when you want to perform mathematical operations on the data in tables while retrieving them by writing SQL **SELECT queries**. They are used with numerical data stored in database tables.

**Arithmetic operators** can be used in the **SELECT clause** as well as in the **WHERE clause** of a SQL SELECT statement. When used in the WHERE clause, they perform operations on specific rows only, filtering out the data that a particular SQL statement is working on.

The common arithmetic operators are:
- **Addition (+)**
- **Subtraction (-)**
- **Multiplication (*)**
- **Division (/)** 
- **Modulus (%)**

### Using the Addition Operator
The SQL addition operator performs the mathematical addition operation on numerical data within columns in a table. 

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column_name1 + column_name2 FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
Imagine an **employee** table:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | allowance |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | Alex           | 25000  | 1000      |
| 2           | John           | 55000  | 1000      |
| 3           | James          | 52000  | 1000      |
| 4           | Sam            | 30000  | 1000      |

To get the total salaries with allowance added:
```sql
SELECT salary + allowance FROM employee;
```
**Output**:

| Salary + allowance |
|--------------------|
| 26000              |
| 56000              |
| 53000              |
| 31000              |

### Using the Addition Operator in WHERE Clause
Retrieve salaries of employees whose total salary is 25000:

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee 
WHERE salary + allowance = 25000;
```
**Output**:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | allowance |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | Alex           | 24000  | 1000      |
| 4           | Sam            | 24000  | 1000      |

### Using the Subtraction Operator
The SQL subtraction operator performs mathematical subtraction on numerical data within columns in a database table.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column_name1 - column_name2 FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
Consider an employee table with a **Tax** column:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | allowance | tax |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|-----|
| 1           | Alex           | 24000  | 1000      | 1000|
| 2           | John           | 55000  | 1000      | 2000|
| 3           | James          | 52000  | 1000      | 2000|
| 4           | Sam            | 24000  | 1000      | 1000|

Retrieve salaries after deducting tax:
```sql
SELECT salary - tax FROM employee;
```
**Output**:

| salary â€“ tax |
|--------------|
| 23000        |
| 53000        |
| 50000        |
| 23000        |

### Using the Subtraction Operator in WHERE Clause
Find employees with a salary of 50000 after tax deduction:

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee 
WHERE salary - tax = 50000;
```
**Output**:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | allowance | tax |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|-----|
| 3           | James          | 52000  | 1000      | 2000|

### Using the Multiplication Operator
The SQL multiplication operator multiplies numerical data in columns.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column_name1 * column_name2 FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
Double the tax amounts for each employee:
```sql
SELECT tax * 2 FROM employee;
```
**Output**:

| tax * 2 |
|---------|
| 2000    |
| 4000    |
| 4000    |
| 2000    |

### Using the Multiplication Operator in WHERE Clause
Find who pays 4000 in tax after doubling the current tax value:

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT *  
FROM employee 
WHERE tax * 2 = 4000;
```
**Output**:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | allowance | tax |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|-----|
| 2           | John           | 55000  | 1000      | 2000|
| 3           | James          | 52000  | 1000      | 2000|

### Using the Division Operator
The division operator divides numerical values from one column by those from another column.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column_name1 / column_name2 FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
Find the allowance percentage each employee receives:
```sql
SELECT allowance / salary * 100 FROM employee;
```
**Output**:

| allowance / salary * 100 |
|--------------------------|
| 4.1667                   |
| 5.4545                   |
| 5.7692                   |
| 4.1667                   |

### Using the Division Operator in WHERE Clause
Find employees who get an allowance of at least 5%:

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT *  
FROM employee 
WHERE allowance / salary * 100 >= 5;
```
**Output**:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | allowance | tax |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|-----|
| 2           | John           | 55000  | 3000      | 2000|
| 3           | James          | 52000  | 3000      | 2000|

### Using the Modulus Operator
The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column_name1 % column_name2 FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
Find if the number of hours worked by each employee is even:
```sql
SELECT hours % 2 FROM employee;
```
**Output**:

| hours % 2 |
|-----------|
| 0         |
| 1         |
| 1         |
| 1         |

### Using the Modulus Operator in WHERE Clause
Filter employees who worked an even number of hours:

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee 
WHERE hours % 2 = 0;
```
**Output**:

| employee_ID | employee_name | salary | hours | allowance | tax |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-------|-----------|-----|
| 1           | Alex           | 24000  | 10    | 1000      | 1000|

### Using SQL Arithmetic Operators in Practice

In this section, we'll take a step further in understanding how to use SQL arithmetic operators with practical data from a corporate table of employee information. This table includes details such as **ID, name**, and **salary**. Let's explore various scenarios where these arithmetic operators can be applied.

#### Adding a Bonus to Each Employee's Salary
Imagine an employer wants to give each employee a $500 bonus and see the updated salaries.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT salary + 500 FROM employee;
```
- The **SELECT** command retrieves each employee's salary from the **employee** table.
- The **+** operator adds $500 to each salary.

**Result**:
Each employee's salary is increased by $500.

#### Deducting an Amount from Each Employee's Salary
Now, suppose the employer wants to deduct $500 from each employee's salary.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT salary - 500 FROM employee;
```
- The **SELECT** command retrieves each employee's salary.
- The **-** operator subtracts $500 from each salary.

**Result**:
Each employee's salary is reduced by $500.

#### Doubling Each Employee's Salary
The employer decides to double each employee's current annual salary.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT salary * 2 FROM employee;
```
- The **SELECT** command retrieves each employee's salary.
- The **\*** operator multiplies each salary by 2.

**Result**:
Each employee's salary is doubled.

#### Calculating Monthly Salary
To determine the monthly salary for each employee, divide the annual salary by 12.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT salary / 12 FROM employee;
```
- The **SELECT** command retrieves each employee's annual salary.
- The **/** operator divides the annual salary by 12 to calculate the monthly salary.

**Result**:
The monthly salary for each employee is displayed.

#### Checking If Employee IDs Are Even or Odd
To determine if each employee's ID is an even or odd number, use the modulus operator.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT ID % 2 FROM employee;
```
- The **SELECT** command retrieves each employee's ID.
- The **%** operator divides each ID by 2 and returns the remainder.

**Result**:
- A remainder of 0 indicates an even ID.
- A non-zero remainder indicates an odd ID.

**Output**:
The results show which employee IDs are even and which are odd.
